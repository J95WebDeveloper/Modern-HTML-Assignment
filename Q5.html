        <summary>Vector Graphics</summary>
        <p>
          This is a new addition to the revised version which has hugely
          impacted the use of Adobe Flash in websites. It can be used to draw
          graphics with various shapes and colors via scripting usually JS.
          Vector graphics are scalable, easy to create and edit. It also
          supports interactivity and animation. Having a smaller file size makes
          transferring and loading graphics much faster on the web. That's the
          reason why many people prefer to use vector graphics.

        <summary>Header and Footer</summary>
        <p>
            With the use of new tags Header and Footer, there is no longer a need 
            to identify the two elements with a &lt;div&gt; tag. Footer is placed at the 
            end of the web page while Header is placed at the start of the web page.
            By using &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; HTML5 elements, the browser will know what 
            to load first and what to load later. The header can contain-Footer can 
            contain-

            <ul>
                <li>One or more heading elements (&lt;h1&gt; - &lt;/h1&gt;)</li>
                <li>Logo or icon</li>
                <li>Authorship information</li>
            </ul>

        <summary> Figure and Figcaption</summary>
        <p>
            HTML5 allows to use a &lt;figure&gt; element to mark up a photo in a document,
            and a &lt;figcaption&gt; element to define a caption for the photo. The 
            &lt;figcaption&gt; tag defines a caption for a &lt;figure&gt; element. This tag
            provides a container for content that is equivalent to a figure. 
            It can be used to group a caption with one or more images, a block of
            code, or other content.
