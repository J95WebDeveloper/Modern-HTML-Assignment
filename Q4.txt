Q4. List any 3 ways which help us in imporving the accessibility of HTML.

Answer - 

Imporving the Accessibility - 

* Use a CMS that supports accessibility : 

when building a website, choose a content management system (CMS) that supports web accessibility. 
Be sure that page layouts, themes, widgets, plugins, and other aspects are compatible with web 
accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.0.

* Assign alt tags for images :  

Images on a webpage provide great value to users. Nonetheless, they can create barriers for users 
with limited or impaired vision. Therefore, assigning alt tags to images will provide a description 
of the images allowing users to understand the image through the use of a screen reader. Alt tags 
also contribute to a higher SEO score on Google.

* Use descriptive title for links : 

Using descriptive titles for links will make it easier for those who rely on screen readers to navigate 
your website to understand the purpose of the link and where they will be redirected.
